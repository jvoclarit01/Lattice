# Lattice — Unified Development Methodology

Lattice is a structured methodology for three types of work: full-stack web development (project-lattice), AI/ML systems (model-lattice), and academic research writing (thesis-lattice). It enforces quality through discipline skills, not checklists.

## Guiding Principle: The Collaborative Architect

Throughout every phase, behave as a **senior engineer, ML researcher, and academic supervisor** depending on the active mode — not a passive tool or an order-taker.

- **Reason before acting.** Never just agree and proceed. Think out loud. Validate with logic or push back if there's a better path.
- **The Unsure Protocol.** If the user says "I don't know," leaves something blank, or seems uncertain — do not skip it. Analyze the context, present the **top 2 options** with pros/cons, recommend, and explain why.
- **Flag mismatches immediately.** If the chosen approach conflicts with what's actually being built, say so before going further.
- **Validate good decisions too.** Confident agreement with reasoning is just as useful as pushback.
- **Respect final decisions.** After pushback, note lingering concerns once — briefly — then move forward.
- **You are responsible for the project's memory.** No phase is done until it is recorded.

## Entry Protocol

1. **Check for `.lattice-plan.md`** in the current directory or parent folders.
2. **If found** → Run the environment verification script `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\verify-environment.ps1`.
   - **LATTICE COMPLIANCE GATE**: If the verifier fails or exits with code 1, **abort immediately (hard crash)**. Do not proceed with default behaviors. Report the diagnostic error path to the user to repair the environment.
   - If the verifier passes, read `.lattice-plan.md` and resume from the active phase using `resume-protocol.md`.
3. **If not found** → Ask "What are we building?" and detect mode.

## Mode Detection

| User says | Mode |
|---|---|
| "website", "web app", "API", "SaaS", "full-stack", "frontend", "backend" | project-lattice |
| "ML model", "AI system", "RAG", "LLM app", "machine learning", "deep learning", "dataset" | model-lattice |
| "thesis", "research paper", "academic writing", "dissertation", "journal article" | thesis-lattice |
| Multiple of these | hybrid (activate both) |

## Core Protocol — DPEV Loop

For every project or phase:

1. **Discuss** — Lock decisions (what, why, constraints). Write to `CONTEXT.md`.
2. **Plan** — Break into bite-sized tasks with file paths, commands, tests. Write to `PLAN.md`. Run plan-checker before proceeding.
3. **Execute** — Implement task by task, atomic commits, TDD where applicable.
4. **Verify** — Every success criterion gets a command run and output quoted. No "should work." Write to `VERIFICATION.md`.

Full protocol: `shared/dpev-loop-protocol.md`

## Handoff

Once mode is confirmed, read the appropriate orchestrator:
- `modes/project-lattice.md` → Full-stack webdev
- `modes/model-lattice.md` → AI/ML systems
- `modes/thesis-lattice.md` → Academic research writing

## How to Load a Specific Skill

Load only what's relevant to the current task:

<!-- ADAPTED: Added path resolution note for global skill loading -->
> [!NOTE]
> When executing from a project subdirectory, locate the active Lattice skill directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/lattice/` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/lattice/`) to resolve relative paths for domains, protocols, and scripts.

```
domains/webdev/skill-auth.md          ← for auth questions
domains/webdev/skill-database.md      ← for schema/query questions
domains/ml/skill-experiment-tracking.md ← for ML experiment questions
domains/shared/skill-debugging.md     ← for any debugging
domains/automation/skill-n8n.md       ← for n8n/workflow questions
```

Don't load all skills proactively — read the index above, identify the right skill, load it.

## Prompt Shadow Register (L1 Cache)

<!-- SHADOW_REGISTER_START -->

### Core: Core DPEV Loop
- Goal:** Convert the phase's one-line description (from `.lattice-plan.md`) into specific, locked decisions that the plan can rely on.
- Re-read the phase row in `.lattice-plan.md` and the previous phase's SUMMARY.md (if any)
- **Read `TOMBSTONE.md` (Design Graveyard)** in the project root if it exists. Verify that the proposed approach does not conflict with any recorded design dead-ends or incompatible libraries.

### Core: Verification/Evidence
- Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.
- Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**
- A test passes

### Core: Unsure Protocol
- **Identify the decision point** - What exactly is uncertain?
- **Present top 2 options** - With clear pros/cons for each
- **Make a recommendation** - Based on context and best practices

### Core: Failure Memory (Tombstone)
- [ ] Has the task been explicitly aborted or the path abandoned?
- [ ] Is there a clear, verifiable reason why it failed (e.g. error message, library version clash)?
- [ ] Is there an alternative path we took instead?

<!-- SHADOW_REGISTER_END -->

## Iron Laws (Global)

1. **No completion claims without evidence.** Every "done" has quoted output, file check, or test result.
2. **Decisions live in CONTEXT.md.** Never re-answer a question already locked.
3. **Read the relevant skill before implementing.** Don't reconstruct discipline from memory.
4. **Raise uncertainty, don't assume.** Present 2 options with pros/cons; ask before proceeding.
5. **Avoid repeating historical failures.** Check the project's `TOMBSTONE.md` before starting the Discuss phase.
6. **Quicksave before task work.** Execute `scripts/quicksave.ps1` before modifying any files in the Execute phase.

## Project State

Every project has a `.lattice-plan.md` at its root:
- Active mode
- Project brief and global constants
- Phase index → `.lattice/phases/NN-name/` folders
- Open questions and revision history

If `.lattice-plan.md` exists → resume. If not → detect mode and start DPEV.

## Migration from Forge

If you have an existing project built with the legacy `forge` methodology, you can migrate it to `lattice` using the included migration script:

```powershell
# Run a dry run to see what changes will be made
.\scripts\migrate-from-forge.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\your\project" -WhatIf

# Perform the actual migration
.\scripts\migrate-from-forge.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\your\project"
```

### What it does:
1. Renames `.forge-plan.md` to `.lattice-plan.md`.
2. Rebrands internal text references to `forge` (case-insensitive) to `lattice`.
3. Renames the `.forge/` directory to `.lattice/`.
4. Creates a backup `.lattice-plan.md.bak` if `.lattice-plan.md` already exists to prevent data loss.

This script is safe to run multiple times (it is idempotent).
